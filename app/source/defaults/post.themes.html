<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Leafpub templates are built with a simple but powerful template system called <em>Handlebars</em>. If you've never used Handlebars before, <a href="https://www.leafpub.org/intro-to-handlebars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you're in for a treat</a>.</p>
<p>Handlebar templates are easy to create and don't require any PHP programming whatsoever.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to open the <em>.hbs</em> files in <strong>content/themes/range</strong> and play around with them. They're just HTML files with <code>{{placeholders}}</code>, so it won't be long before you're building your own themes. For more info about themes, check out <a href="https://www.leafpub.org/tag/themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these posts</a>.</p>
<p>Tip: You might need to configure your text editor to open <em>.hbs</em> files.</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins are able to extend Leafpub in many ways.&nbsp;<br>They can be a middleware or subscribe to any Leafpub event that gets fired.<br>It's also possible to define own routes and create new endpoints.</p>
